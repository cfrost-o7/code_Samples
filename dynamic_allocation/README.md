# Dynamic Allocation
This assignment is written in C to run on a Linux server. It is not guaranteed to work on Windows or macOS.
This assignment centered around modeling dynamic memory allocation. It maintained two linked lists, one for storage and one for the "holes" in the total storage that are open for future allocation.
The functions written are the ones called by the professors testing file. I received full marks on this assignment.
